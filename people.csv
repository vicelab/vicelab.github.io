alan-cai,Alan Cai,Graduate Student,acai4@ucmerced.edu,,,"Alan is a Master's student in the Environmental Systems Graduate Group and VICE Lab at UC Merced, having joined in July 2017. He is interested in using the tools of science and policy to better manage ecosystems, particularly rivers, for a variety of objectives. Alan majored in environmental and atmospheric science at UC Berkeley, graduating in 2014. He then did internships in applied ecosystem science and land use policy in the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington state. <br><br> Alan's research project currently involves a survey of Western United States hydropower facility operators.  He is interested in gaining a baseline understanding of the priorities, attitudes, and decision-making processes of this group, with a focus on environmental flows.  Given how important their actions are to the water resources, energy and riverine ecosystem arenas, Alan hopes to obtain insights that can inform models of optimized hydropower operations under conditions of climate change and multi-objective decision-making.",,,,,,,,,,,
vicky-espinoza,Vicky Espinoza,Graduate Student,vespinoza2@ucmerced.edu,,https://github.com/espinozav,"Vicky joined the VICElab as a PhD student in fall of 2017. She graduated from the University of Southern California in May 2017 with a Master of Science degree in Environmental Engineering. She obtained her Bachelor of Science degree in Geophysical Sciences from the University of Chicago. Prior applied research experiences at Argonne National Laboratory, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pomona College Geology Department, and University of Alaska Fairbanks include research in various fields like atmospheric and ocean chemistry, energy-water systems, and climate change impacts on atmospheric river trends. She has also been actively involved in making science and mathematics accessible to underrepresented, Spanish-speaking communities through outreach and tutoring throughout her educational career. <br><br> Vicky's research addresses sustainable water management for global food, energy, and water security. She is analyzing how California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act will impact the retirement of more than 10% of San Joaquin Valley's irrigated lands, and how those land use change will affect already socioeconomically vulnerable communities within the region. Overall, her research will offer a vision for strategizing how and where to retire large blocks of land and suggest alternative land uses that will maximize the benefit to the economy, environment, farmers, and underrepresented communities. She hopes that her research will translate into broad insights that can inform water management and policy, while resulting in more equitable solutions for disadvantaged communities in California and beyond.<br><br><h3 style='margin:3em; color:white'>News/Media Highlights</h3><ul><li>Chicago Council on Global Affairs Next Gen Delegate 2019: <a href=https://news.ucmerced.edu/news/2019/grad-student-represents-valley-global-food-security-symposium>https://news.ucmerced.edu/news/2019/grad-student-represents-valley-global-food-security-symposium</a></li><li>Graduate Research Advocacy Day 2019 (Sacramento): <a href=https://news.ucmerced.edu/news/2019/graduate-students-make-case-research-capitol>https://news.ucmerced.edu/news/2019/graduate-students-make-case-research-capitol</a></li><li>2019 USDA Fellows: <a href=https://www.appliedarts.txstate.edu/Announcement/2019-USDA-Fellows.html>https://www.appliedarts.txstate.edu/Announcement/2019-USDA-Fellows.html</a></li><li>Imagine H2O fellowship + global climate action summit 2018: <a href=https://news.ucmerced.edu/news/2018/uc-climate-change-research-one-focus-global-summit-new-reports>https://news.ucmerced.edu/news/2018/uc-climate-change-research-one-focus-global-summit-new-reports</a></li><li>NASA JPL News on Atmospheric Rivers 2018 : <a href=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7141>https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7141</a></li><li>NASA JPL News Intern Highlight 2018: <a href=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/news/2018/10/4/rolling-on-the-science-of-an-atmospheric-river>https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/news/2018/10/4/rolling-on-the-science-of-an-atmospheric-river</a></li></ul>",,,,,,,,,,,

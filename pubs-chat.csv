Carbon stock quantification in a floodplain restoration chronosequence along a Mediterranean-montane riparian corridor. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969724039767","Uncertainty in the global carbon (C) budget has been reduced for most stocks, though it remains incomplete by not considering aquatic and transitional zone carbon stocks. A key issue preventing such complete accounting is a lack of available C data within these aquatic and aquatic-terrestrial transitional ecosystems. Concurrently, quantifiable results produced by restoration practices that explicitly target C stock accumulation and sequestration remain inconsistent or undocumented. To support a more complete carbon budget and identify impacts on C stock accumulation from restoration treatment actions, we investigated C stock values in a Mediterraneanmontane riparian floodplain system in California, USA. We quantified the C stock in aboveground biomass, large wood, and litter in addition to the C and total nitrogen in the upper soil profile (5 cm) across 23 unique restoration treatments and remnant old-growth forests. Treatments span 40 years of restoration actions along seven river kilometers of the Cosumnes River, and include process-based (limited intervention), assisted (horticultural planting and other intensive restoration activities), hybrid (a combination of process and assisted actions), and remnant (old-growth forests that were not created with restoration actions) sites. Total C values measured up to 1100 Mg ha- 1 and averaged 129 Mg ha- 1 with biomass contributing the most to individual plot measurements. From 2012 to 2020, biomass C stock measurements showed an average 32 Mg ha- 1 increase across all treatments, though treatment specific values varied. While remnant forest plots held the highest average C values across all stocks (336 Mg ha- 1), C values of different stocks varied across treatment type. Process-based restoration treatments held more average biomass C (120 Mg ha- 1) than hybrid (23 Mg ha- 1) or assisted restoration treatments (50 Mg ha- 1), while assisted restoration treatments held more average total C in soil and litter (58 Mg ha- 1) than hybrid (35 Mg ha- 1) and process-based restoration treatments (37 Mg ha- 1). Regardless of treatment type, time was a significant factor for all C stock values. These findings support a more inclusive global carbon budget and provide valuable insight into restoration treatment actions that support C stock accumulation.",2024,biomass;california;carbon-storage;central-valley;climate;cosumnes-river;floodplain-restoration;floodplains;forest-carbon;land;large-wood;multi-benefit-restoration;nature-based-solutions;nitrogen;plant-diversity;riparian;riparian-floodplain;river-restoration;soil-carbon,california;central-valley;cosumnes-river;united-states

(2024). Complex drivers of geomorphic response and habitat formation revealed in multiyear monitoring of Cosumnes River experimental floodplain reconnection. https://journals.plos.org/water/article?id=10.1371/journal.pwat.0000132","In this study, we examine a novel levee breach experiment that reconnected a floodplain along the Cosumnes River, California to determine the decadal impact of removing 250 meters of levee and assess the recruitment of large wood. This is the latest study in an ongoing series of investigations 40 years in the making along the largest river on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada without a major dam. We present the findings of this multi-modal investigation here by first measuring the geomorphic alteration of the floodplain surface to quantify the depletion and accretion of sediment across the excavated site. We then identify and quantify the deposition of large wood. Results indicate initiation of anastomosing channel formation and distinct areas of large wood recruitment supporting a naturally evolving lateral levee. Accretion resulted in more than 25,000 m3 of sediment deposition within the original excavation site, the development of multiple sand splays, and natural recruitment of native riparian tree species. We conclude by discussing implications following other approaches to floodplain restoration as a Nature-based Solution. In episodic flow regimes, like in California's Mediterranean-montane hydroclimatic regime, restoring lateral hydrologic connectivity facilitates ecosystem function. Large flood pulse events drive sediment dynamics and geomorphic heterogeneity while enriching biodiversity through biogeochemical fluxes and habitat creation on reconnected floodplains that store floodwaters and reduce peak discharge. These findings support the importance of long-term monitoring efforts of floodplain restoration",2024,california;central-valley;cosumnes-river;floodplains;riparian;sierra-nevada;water-resources,california;central-valley;cosumnes-river;sierra-nevada

From fallow ground to common ground: Perspectives on future land uses in the San Joaquin valley under sustainable groundwater management. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479723000142","Agriculture dominates California's San Joaquin Valley with over five million acres of farmland produces 400 different commodities ranging from nuts, tree fruits, vines, and row crops. During dry years agricultural production in the San Joaquin Valley uses about 53% of total applied water in the state. Implementation of California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) will restrict groundwater pumping, likely reducing irrigated agricultural land use resulting in conversion to alternative land uses. To promote collaborative and inclusive efforts to repurpose agricultural land, California's legislature established a funding program administered by the Department of Conservation, the Multibenefit Land Repurposing Program (MLRP), in 2021. To ensure that land repurposing plans under the MLRP and SGMA represent San Joaquin Valley community needs this paper examines public perceptions of future land uses under SGMA through a phone survey. Respondents (n = 197) were recruited through a stratified random sample of mobile numbers registered within communities in the San Joaquin Valley classified as disadvantaged communities (DACs) (n = 32). Our results show that most respondents were somewhat (33%) or not at all (54%) familiar with SGMA, highlighting the need for outreach efforts to overcome barriers to representation, translation, and education about future water and land use decisions. Survey respondents identified secure water supplies (e.g., groundwater recharge) (35%) and less-water intensive agriculture (27%) as their top land use priorities to address groundwater overdraft under SGMA, indicating that the status quo for land use is preferred to alternative land uses. Preference for maintaining agriculture as primary land use (27%), we correlated with agricultural identity and lack of interest in community or global benefits such as schools and climate change mitigation. The findings from this study underscore the local variability in land use values and the importance to engaging local communities in land use decision-making, especially as they relate to changing current practices toward a more climate-resilient but agriculturally productive future with less land and less water.",2023,agriculture;california;climate-change;communities;groundwater;sgma;water-resources,california;central-valley;san-joaquin-valley

Land Use Misclassification Results in Water Use; Economic Value; and GHG Emission Discrepancies in California's High-Intensity Agriculture Region. https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/8/6829","California's San Joaquin Valley is both drought-prone and water-scarce but relies on high-intensity agriculture as its primary economy. Climate change adaptation strategies for high-intensity agriculture require reliable and highly resolved land use classification data to accurately account for changes in crop water demand, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and farmgate revenue. Understanding direct and indirect economic impacts from potential changes to high-intensity agriculture to reduce groundwater overdrafts, such as reductions in the cultivated area or switching to less water-intensive crops, is unachievable if land use data are too coarse and inconsistent or misclassified. This study quantified the revenue, crop water requirement, and GHG emission discrepancies resulting from land use misclassification in the United States' most complex agricultural region, California's San Joaquin Valley. By comparing three commonly used land use classification datasets-CropScape, Land IQ, and Kern County Agriculture-this study found that CropScape led to considerable revenue and crop water requirement discrepancies compared to other sources. Crop misclassification across all datasets resulted in an underestimation of GHG emissions. The total revenue discrepancies of misclassified crops by area for the 2016 dataset comparisons result in underestimations by CropScape of around USD 3 billion and overestimation by LIQ and Kern Ag of USD 72 million. Reducing crop misclassification discrepancies is essential for crafting climate resilience strategies, especially for California, which generates USD 50 billion in annual agricultural revenue",2023,agriculture;california;climate-change;communities;groundwater;sgma;water-resources,california;central-valley;san-joaquin-valley;united-states

(2022). Special report: The AgAID AI institute for transforming workforce and decision support in agriculture. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168169922002617","Tackling the grand challenges of 21st century agriculture (Ag) will require a fundamental shift in the way we envision the role of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and in the way we build agricultural AI systems. This shift is needed especially for complex, high-value agricultural ecosystems such as those in the Western U.S., where 300+ crops are grown. Farmers and policy makers in this region face variable profitability, major crop loss and poor crop quality owing to several challenges, including increased labor costs and shortages of skilled workers, weather and management uncertainties, and water scarcity. While AI is expected to be a significant tool for addressing these challenges, AI capabilities must be expanded and will need to account for human input and human behavior - calling for a strong AI-Ag coalition that also creates new opportunities to achieve sustained innovation. Accomplishing this goal goes well beyond the scope of any specific research project or disciplinary silo and requires a more holistic transdisciplinary effort in research, development, and training. To respond to this need, we initiated the AgAID Institute, a multi-institution, transdisciplinary National AI Research Institute that will build new public-private partnerships involving a diverse range of stakeholders in both agriculture and AI. The institute focuses its efforts on providing AI solutions to specialty crop agriculture where the challenges pertaining to water availability, climate variability and extreme weather, and labor shortages, are all significantly pronounced. Our approach to all AgAID Institute activities is being guided by three cross-cutting principles: (i) adoption as a first principle in AI design; (ii) adaptability to changing environments and scales, and (iii) amplification of human skills and machine efficiency. The AgAID Institute is conducting a range of activities including: using agricultural AI applications as testbeds for developing innovative AI technologies and workflows; laying the technological foundations for climate-smart agriculture; serving as a nexus for culturally inclusive collaborative and transdisciplinary learning and knowledge co-production; preparing the next generation workforce for careers at the intersection of Ag and AI technology; and facilitating technology adoption and transfer.",2022,agriculture;ai;climate-change;water-resources,california;united-states;washington

Energy and water co-benefits from covering canals with solar panels. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00693-8","Solar power development over canals is an emerging response to the energy-water-food nexus that can result in multiple benefits for water and energy infrastructure. Case studies of over-canal solar photovoltaic arrays have demonstrated enhanced photovoltaic performance due to the cooler microclimate next to the canal. In addition, shade from the photovoltaic panels has been shown to mitigate evaporation and potentially mitigate aquatic weed growth. However, the evaporation savings and financial co-benefits have not been quantified across major canal systems. Here we use regional hydrologic and techno-economic simulations of solar photovoltaic panels covering California's 6,350?km canal network, which is the world's largest conveyance system and covers a wide range of climates, insolation rates and water costs. We find that over-canal solar could reduce annual evaporation by an average of 39?±?12 thousand m3 per km of canal. Furthermore, the financial benefits from shading the canals outweigh the added costs of the cable-support structures required to span the canals. The net present value of over-canal solar exceeds conventional overground solar by 20-50%, challenging the convention of leaving canals uncovered and calling into question our understanding of the most economic locations for solar power.",2021,climate-change;energy;modeling;nature;solar;sustainability;water,california;united-states

Although historically many Chinese scientific publications had been limited to regional, language-specific outlets, the more recent emergence of Chinese scholarship in water resources sustainability and engineering suggests that broader recognition within the scientific community is needed. In this study, we explore the recent evolution of Chinese environmental flows research through the bibliometric analysis of two prominent databases. This paper highlights trends in environmental flow publication rates, emerging areas of research, and citation networks for prominent authors in the Chinese context as compared to the global network of environmental flows research. Results indicate that China's environmental flows research developed rapidly over the past two decades (2005-2019) and that Chinese authors are among the most productive in the field (60% of the top 20 authors). However, based on the number of citations, few Chinese articles are among the most highly cited (5 out of 800). The field of environmental flows research has identified the need to minimize parochial boundaries, and this analysis suggests a rich, yet untapped, literature to promote scientific integration. Differences in journal selection, keyword choice, and lesser-known authors to readers outside of China were identified as potential limitations to broader global integration. This approach to systematic bibliometric analysis can be used to identify prominent authors and important studies such that new ideas in environmental flows research can flow across continental boundaries, from East to West, to accelerate global understanding of prevailing trends and best practices in river management.",2021,china;environmental-flows,china

This produced a chronosequence of C storage rates over what is roughly the productive lifespan of most vines (aged 2-30 years). To our knowledge, this study provides the first estimate of C storage rates in the woody biomass of vines. Additionally, we assessed C storage in wildland buffers and adjacent oak-dominated habitats over a 9-year period.",2020,agriculture;california;ecosystem-services;vineyards,california

This study compares measurements of evapotranspiration (ET) from a commercial vineyard in California using data collected from sUAS and EOS sources for 10 events over a growing season using multiple ET estimation methods. Results indicate that sUAS ET estimates that include non-canopy pixels are generally lower on average than EOS methods by >0.5 mm day?1. sUAS ET estimates that mask out non-canopy pixels are generally higher than EOS methods by <0.5 mm day?1. Masked sUAS ET estimates are less variable than unmasked sUAS and EOS ET estimates. This study indicates that limited deployment of sUAS can provide important estimates of uncertainty in EOS ET estimations for larger areas and to also improve irrigation management at a local scale.",2020,agriculture;remote-sensing;vineyards;water-resources,california;central-valley

Exploring the multiscale hydrologic regulation of multipond systems in a humid agricultural catchment. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0043135420305248","Assessing the hydrologic processes over scales ranging from single wetland to regional is critical to understand the hydrologically-driven ecosystem services especially nutrient buffering of wetlands. Here, we present a novel approach to quantify the multiscale hydrologic regulation of multipond systems (MPSs), a common type of small, scattered wetland in humid agricultural regions, because previous studies have stopped in commending the catchment scale flood and drought resilience of these waters, and contemporary models do not adequately represent the corresponding intra-catchment fill-spill relationships. A new version of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was developed to incorporate improved representation of: (1) perennial or intermittent spillage connections of pond-to-pond and pond-to-stream, and (2) bidirectional exchange between pond surface water and shallow groundwater. We present SWAT-MPS, which adopts rule-based artificial intelligence to model the possibilities of different spillage directions and GA-based parameter optimization over the two simulation years (June 2017 to May 2019), with successfully replicated streamflow and pond water-level variations in a 4.8 km2 test catchment, southern China. Water balance analysis and scenario simulations were then executed to assess the hydrologic regulation at single pond, single MPS, and entire catchment scales. Results revealed (1) the presence of 9 series- or series-parallel connected MPSs, in which pond overflow accounted for as much as 59% of the catchment water yield; (2) seasonally- and MPS-independent baseflow support and quickflow attenuation, with ranked level of pond water storage for baseflow support across different landuse types: forest > farm > village, and inversed correlation of pond spillage to baseflow and quickflow variations in the farmland; and (3) MPS-aggregated catchment flood peak reduction (>20%) and baseflow increment (26%) in the following dry days. Meteorological data analysis and simulated average daily values indicated these hydrologic patterns are credible even if extending to a 5-year period. As a first modelling attempt to explore the intra-catchment details of MPSs, our study underscores the water storage and connectivity in their hydrologic regulation, and suggests inventories, long-term field monitoring, and several research directions of the new model for integrated pond management in watersheds and river basins. These findings can inform refined assessment of similar small, scattered wetlands elsewhere, where restoration efforts are required.",2020,agriculture;ecosystem-services;groundwater;hydrology;modeling;water-resources,china

Interaction of restored hydrological connectivity and herbicide suppresses dominance of a floodplain invasive species. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rec.13240","Invasive species present one of the largest threats to the recruitment and persistence of native plant communities. Land managers generally apply two approaches to help control invasive species and restore native plant communities: (1) improve ecosystem processes that preferentially support native species (e.g. reintroduce disturbance regimes) or (2) directly treat non?native species (e.g. herbicide use). Few utilize both. Over nearly a decade, we tracked the establishment and population growth of Lepidium latifolium (perennial pepperweed) on a hydrologically restored floodplain and adjacent grassland sites, concurrently with a controlled herbicide application experiment. We found that perennial pepperweed stem counts were lower in years with longer duration flood events (p?<?0.0001) and after herbicide application (p?<?0.0005). In floodplain areas, native species increased in the years following herbicide treatments or after wet water years, while grassland sites were reinvaded by other non?native species. Our results suggest that long inundation periods can effectively control perennial pepperweed over large areas when used in concert with herbicide control during dry years or in drier areas. Given the natural variability in inundation periods, our study highlights the need for longer?term (>3-5?years) studies to evaluate the effectiveness of invasive species control programs. Overall, our study emphasized the need for further integration of traditional weed control approaches with restored ecological function to effectively control invasive plants and stimulate native plant recovery.",2020,floodplain;floodplains;hydrology;management;pepperweed;riparian,cosumnes-river

Here, we describe the variability in water quality and POM variables, and assess factors associated with that variability using dimensional reduction and linear modelling within the context of our habitat types. The stable isotope composition of freshwater POM and water chemistry variables differed significantly across small areas (<10 km) and short time frames (weekly). Hydrological connectivity amongst sites was found to be an important factor in the isotopic and elemental composition of POM. During periods of low hydrological connectivity, in situ dynamics were strongly associated with differentiation of POM in different habitats. Discharge (16-433 m3/s) and water temperature (8-30°C) were the variables most associated with variations in the composition of POM. Slackwater sites showed the greatest variability in POM composition, which may be symptomatic of longer water residence times, increased cycling rates of nutrients and organic matter, or a combination of the two. Variability in POM stable isotope composition demonstrates that caution should be exercised when interpreting analyses that assume a static POM stable isotope composition based on two?end member mixing. Unconstrained variability in space or time could confound interpretations of models and data. Moving forward, conceptual and numerical models for river ecosystems that emphasise temporally heterogeneous lateral exchange amongst habitat patches should be prioritised when considering restoration efforts and monitoring outcomes.",2020,california;central-valley;cosumnes-river;floodplain;foodweb;hydrology;modeling;restoration,california;central-valley;cosumnes-river

Reestablishing geomorphological and hydrological conditions necessary to sustain ecosystems is a central challenge for restoration within highly altered systems. Meeting this challenge requires simultaneously addressing multiple and interacting stressors within the context of irreversible changes and socio?economic constraints. Traditionally, river restoration approaches either physically change the landscape or channel (channel?floodplain manipulation) or adjust hydrology (environmental flows), and such actions are often independent. We juxtapose these two subfields of river restoration, which have undergone parallel transformations, from goals of reproducing static representations of form and flow regime to goals of reestablishing processes. The parallel transformations have generated shared ideas, which point to benefits of coupling channel?floodplain manipulation and environmental flow actions to achieve process?based goals. Such coupling supports comprehensive river restoration efforts aimed at supporting resilient ecosystems within human dominated landscapes in a nonstationary climate. We identify four elements of coupled approaches for restoring highly modified rivers: (1) identify physical and ecological process potential given interactive effects of altered landscapes and flows; (2) consider capacity for sustaining identified processes under potential future change; (3) model alternatives for coupled restoration actions to support identified processes; and (4) evaluate alternatives using metrics representing integrative effects of coupled actions. We suggest these emergent elements contribute to the development of standard practices for restoring highly modified rivers and encourage an increasing number and quality of coupled applications.",2019,climate-change;floodplain;floodplains;hydrology;modeling;restoration;riparian,california

In this study, we assess the public and private costs and benefits of distributed desalination in the Central Valley (CV) of California. We employ environmental and economic modeling to estimate the value of reducing the salinity of irrigation water; the value of augmenting water supply under present and future climate scenarios; and the human health, environmental, and climate change damages associated with generating power to desalinate water. We find that water desalination is only likely to be profitable in 4% of the CV during periods of severe drought, and that current costs would need to decrease by 70â""90% for adoption to occur on the median acre. Fossil-fuel powered desalination technologies also generate air emissions that impose significant public costs in the form of human health and climate change damages, although these damages vary greatly depending on technology.

Ecological data and studies for the region are also limited, making informed conservation in agricultural landscapes difficult. The increasing availability of remotely sensed data provide opportunities to relate species occurrences to measures of landscape heterogeneity even when field measures of habitat structure are lacking. When working with such remotely sensed data, itâs important to select appropriate measures of heterogeneity, including common metrics of landscape composition as well as frequently overlooked shape metrics. In this contribution we combine bird surveys with multispectral satellite imagery to develop boosted regression tree models of avian species richness, and of habitat use for 15 species across a mixed vineyard-matorral landscape in central Chile. We found a range of associations between individual species and land cover types, with the majority of species occurring most frequently in remnant habitats and ecotones rather than the interiors of large vineyard blocks. Models identified both metrics of landscape composition and patch shape as being important predictors of species occurrence, suggesting that shape metrics can complement more commonly used metrics of landscape composition. Vineyards that include corridors or islands of remnant habitat among vine blocks may increase the amount of area available to many species, although some species may still require large tracts of intact natural habitat to persist.",,agriculture;biodiversity;climate-change;modeling;vineyards,chile

However, riverside levees restrict lateral connectivity of water and sediment during flood pulses, making the re-introduction of floodplain hydrogeomorphic processes through intentional levee breaching and removal an emerging floodplain restoration practice. Repeated topographic observations from levee breach sites along the lower Cosumnes River (USA) indicated that breach architecture influences floodplain and channel hydrogeomorphic processes. Where narrow breaches (<75 m) open onto graded floodplains, archetypal crevasse splays developed along a single dominant flowpath, with floodplain erosion in near-bank areas and lobate splay deposition in distal floodplain regions. Narrow breaches opening into excavated floodplain channels promoted both transverse advection and turbulent diffusion of sediment into the floodplain channel, facilitating near-bank deposition and potential breach closure. Wide breaches (>250 m) enabled multiple modes of water and sediment transport onto graded floodplains. Advective sediment transport along multiple flow paths generated overlapping crevasse splays, while turbulent diffusion promoted the formation of lateral levees through large wood and sediment accumulation in near-bank areas. Channel incision (>2 m) upstream from a wide levee breach suggests that large flow diversions through such breaches can generate water surface drawdown during flooding, resulting in localized flow acceleration and upstream channel incision. Understanding variable hydrogeomorphic responses to levee breach architecture will help restoration managers design breaches that maximize desired floodplain topographic change while also minimizing potential undesirable consequences such as levee breach closure or channel incision.",,california;central-valley;cosumnes-river;environmental-flows;floodplain;floodplains;riparian,california;central-valley;cosumnes-river;united-states

(2017). Meeting ecosystem needs while satisfying human demands. http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa6e87/meta","Regulated rivers worldwide are managed to meet human water demands, including irrigation and hydropower, but resulting flows often fail to support downstream ecosystems. To further confound these management challenges, global climate warming and commensurate hydroclimatic alteration are likely to exacerbate scarcity of water resources and increase competition among its many consumers. Increasing water insecurity is due in part to the assumptions of stationarity in water engineering (Milly et al 2008), in part to increasing human population pressure (Vorosmarty et al 2010), and also in part to the sheer magnitude of anticipated hydrological alteration (Doll and Zhang 2010). The recent publication by Zeng et al (2017) highlights the trade-offs inherent in managing water resources for multiple demands, focusing specifically on hydropower generation versus deliveries for agricultural irrigation supply. At the global scale, the authors found that over half of all installed hydropower competes with irrigation, broadly. More specifically, the authors identified specific locations where competition for water supply between these two sectors is acute, such as in India and Central Asia, due to low streamflow availability, timing of hydropower and irrigation, and evaporative water losses from the reservoirs. Reservoir operations were more synergistic in portions of China and the United States, where demand for hydropower generation and irrigation deliveries were more synchronized seasonally. The consequences for hydroclimatic alteration, such as less snow storage, more variable river discharge, and increased reservoir loss from evaporation, further exacerbate competition for scarce water resources. The analysis by Zeng and colleagues identifies regions that would benefit from expanded trade and diversified energy-water supply portfolios as climate adaptation strategies, but leaves two areas in stark need of additional scientific research: (1) identifying effective policies for balancing trade-offs in meeting water demands under changing hydroclimatic regimes, and consequently (2) developing effective means of managing ecosystems while balancing competing demands for hydropower and irrigation. As a case in point, the most recent drought in California (see Diffenbaugh et al 2015, He et al 2017), exposed one of the world's top agricultural economies to a protracted period of water scarcity that resulted in shocks to agricultural production and labor (Howitt et al 2014), as well as reduced hydropower generation (Gleick 2015). To date, however, few studies have addressed how food-energy-water policies could be implemented to reduce such shocks and improve socioeconomic and ecosystem resilience. In addition to improved coordination among governing agencies and their information management systems (Mount et al 2016), more fundamental changes to policy and practice are needed. Changes to improve food-energy-water system resilience include economic analyses to evaluate ecosystem service versus extraction trade-offs (Grafton et al 2013, Rheinheimer et al 2013), updating water year typologies to reflect non-stationary conditions (Null and Viers 2013, Rheinheimer et al 2016), and formal climate change contingency scenarios for hydropower operations should be adopted to balance competing needs (Viers 2011). Policies are also needed for agricultural land use planning, where groundwater exploitation and degradation has resulted in unsustainable agricultural production (Famiglietti 2014, Rosenstock et al 2014). As the analysis by Zeng et al (2017) makes clear, global water security will be dependent upon several interacting forces that govern water managed for hydropower, irrigation, and ecosystems. Wada and Bierkens (2014) and others have also made it clear that the future sustainability of human water use is doubtful. Thus, the value of such water is likely to increase in the near term and likewise climate adaptation strategies are likely to modify current decision making. Choices for which lands remain in production, or which ones receive surface water irrigation supply at the expense of the environment, will be difficult. It is not a zero sum game, however. Given that hydropower dams are expected to more than double over the next 15 years globally (Zarfl et al 2014), water management strategies that balance ecosystem needs with human demands are urgently needed. A new scientific push toward getting 'more pop per drop' in environmental flow management is focusing on key functional flow components like peak magnitude flows, dry-season low flows, wet-season initiation flows, recession flows, and interannual variability to match life history strategies of focal species (Yarnell et al 2015). A future functional flow paradigm can inform reservoir operations by actively managing for ecosystem services and biodiversity while maintaining conventional operations like flood control, hydropower generation, and irrigation supply. While trade-offs are inevitable, science can help identify compatible water management actions that not only buffer against the worst effects of climate change, but meet ecosystem needs while satisfying human demands.",2017,agriculture;climate-change;ecosystem-services;groundwater;hydropower;management;water-resources,california;china;global;india;united-states

Like other agricultural systems, they can be multifunctional landscapes that not only produce grapes, but also for example serve as wildlife habitat, sequester carbon, and are places of rich traditions. However, research and management practices often focus mostly on individual, specific ecosystem services, without considering multifunctionality. Therefore, we set out to meet four research objectives: (1) evaluate how frequently the ecosystem services approach has been applied in vineyard systems; (2) identify which individual ecosystem services have been most frequently studied in vineyard systems, (3) summarize knowledge on the key ecosystem services identified in (2), and (4) illustrate approaches to multifunctionality in vineyards to inform more holistic land management. For research objective (1), we identified 45 publications that used the term âecosystem servicesâ in relation to vineyards, but found that only seven fully apply the ecosystem service concept to their research. For research objective (2), we operationalized the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) for 27 ecosystem services in vineyards, in order to consider provisioning, regulating, and cultural services through an analysis of more than 4,000 scientific papers that mentioned individual services. We found the six most frequently studied ecosystem services included (1) cultivated crops, (2) filtration, sequestration, storage and accumulation by the vineyards, (3) pest control and (4) disease control, (5) heritage, cultural and (6) scientific services. For research objective (3), we found that research on these six single ecosystem services is highly developed, but relationships between single ecosystem services are less studied. Therefore, we suggest that greater adoption of the ecosystem services approach could help scientists and practitioners to acknowledge the multifunctionality of the agricultural system and gain a holistic perspective that supports more sustainable land management.",2017,agriculture;biodiversity;ecosystem-services;management;vinecology;vineyards,europe

This research identifies a flood regime typology and approach for flood regime characterization, using unsupervised cluster analysis of flood events defined by ecologically meaningful metrics, including magnitude, timing, duration, and rate of change as applied to the unregulated lowland alluvial Cosumnes River of California, United States. Flood events, isolated from the 107-year daily flow record, account for approximately two-thirds of the annual flow volume. Our analysis suggests six flood types best capture the range of flood event variability. Two types are distinguished primarily by high peak flows, another by later season timing and long duration, two by small magnitudes separated by timing, and the last by later peak flow within the flood event. The flood regime was also evaluated through inter- and intra-annual frequency of the identified flood types, their relationship to water year conditions, and their long-term trends. This revealed, for example, year-to-year variability in flood types, associations between wet years and high peak magnitude types and between dry years and the low magnitude, late season flood type, and increasing and decreasing contribution to total annual flow in the highest two peak magnitude classes, respectively. This research focuses needed attention on floodplains, flood hydrology, ecological implications, and the utility of extending flow regime classification typically used for environmental flow targets. The approach is broadly applicable and extensible to other systems, where findings can be used to understand physical processes, assess change, and improve management strategies.",,california;central-valley;cosumnes-river;floodplains;riparian,california;central-valley;cosumnes-river;united-states

Four test cases include passage flows for Chinook salmon and steelhead trout, a minimum instream flow, 80% of natural flow, and a spring recession flow with functional flow components. The model identified late October as consistently water-scarce, even in wet years. These analyses suggest that fall shortages for fish migration could be eliminated through a water exchange agreement combined with use of wells. All cases except the minimum fish passage flow case required acquisition of the largest water rights to decrease environmental shortages by over 80%, with a substantial curtailment in irrigation.",,groundwater;modeling;water-resources;water-rights,california;sierra-nevada

Increasingly, these decisions include instream flow requirements (IFRs) below dams for river ecosystem management. However, WYTs are typically based on assumptions of stationarity, and are thus rendered less meaningful with climate change. Hydrologic alteration resulting from climate change means that a WYT-based IFR scheme using stationary historical observations might inadvertently result in long-term river management outcomes inconsistent with original water management goals. This study assesses the management implications of assuming hydrologic nonstationarity in a WYT-based IFR scheme in Californiaâs upper Yuba River and demonstrates a rolling period of record as a climate adaptation strategy. The existing, nonadaptive water management scheme leads to vastly different possible water allocation outcomes than originally planned for. Results indicate that water year types, if regularly updated, can help maintain historical instream flow distributions. However, gains toward maintaining desired IFRs are obfuscated by future increases in unmanaged reservoir spill. These findings indicate that hydroclimatic uncertainty can partially be accounted for with simple modifications to existing operating rules for reservoirs, though other, risk-based management approaches are also likely needed.",2016,california;climate-change;environmental-flows;management;sierra-nevada,california;sierra-nevada

The statistical approach mimics the simpler, historical forecasting approach that is still widely used. Revenue was calculated using historical electricity prices, with perfect price foresight assumed. With current infrastructure and operations, perfect hydrologic forecasts increased annual hydropower revenue by $0.14 to $1.6 million, with lower values in dry years and higher values in wet years, or about $0.8 million (1.2%) on average, representing overall willingness-to-pay for perfect information. A second sensitivity analysis found a wider range of annual revenue gain or loss using different skill levels in snow measurement in the regression-based forecast, mimicking expected declines in skill as the climate warms and historical snow measurements no longer represent current conditions. The value of perfect forecasts was insensitive to storage capacity for small and large reservoirs, relative to average inflow, and modestly sensitive to storage capacity with medium (current) reservoir storage.

Reference fire regimes in forested ecosystems can be categorized along a gradient ranging from âfuel-limitedâ to âclimate-limitedâ where the former types are often characterized by frequent, lower-severity wildfires and the latter by infrequent, more severe wildfires. Using spatial data on fire severity from 1984â""2011 and metrics related to fire frequency, we tested how divergence from historic (pre-Euroamerican settlement) fire frequencies due to a century of fire suppression influences rates of high-severity fire in five forest types in California. With some variation among bioregions, our results suggest that fires in forest types characterized by fuel-limited fire regimes (e.g., yellow pine and mixed conifer forest) tend to burn with greater proportions of high-severity fire as either time since last fire or the mean modern fire return interval (FRI) increases. Two intermediate fire regime types (mixed evergreen and bigcone Douglas-fir) showed a similar relationship between fire frequency and fire severity. However, red fir and redwood forests, which are characterized by more climate-limited fire regimes, did not show significant positive relationships between FRI and fire severity. This analysis provides strong evidence that for fuel-limited fire regimes, lack of fire leads to increasing rates of high-severity burning. Our study also substantiates the general validity of âfuel-limitedâ vs. âclimate-limitedâ explanations of differing patterns of fire effects and response in forest types of the western US.",2015,climate-change;forest-fire,california;united-states

California's experience restoring the Sacramento - San Joaquin River Delta provides lessons learned and pathways forward to sustain critical ecosystem functions and services in a highly managed riverine delta.. http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AGUFMPA21A..02V","Reconciling the needs of nature and people in California's Sacramento - San Joaquin River Delta represents one of the most critical ecosystem management imperatives in western North America. Over 150 years the Delta has been managed for near-term human benefits and in the process 95% of riverine and deltaic wetlands have been lost throughout the region. Despite extensive land conversion and alteration of hydrological and physical processes, the Delta remains important habitat for migratory birds and is home to over 60% of California's native fish species. It is also the waterwheel for the state's vast water distribution network and is maintained by a system of constructed levees that are at risk from catastrophic failure due to sea level rise, floods, and/or seismic activity. Such a collapse would have dire consequences for > 25M humans and world's 10th largest economy that depend on its freshwater. Thus, the ultimate cost of this ecosystem alteration and simplification is a riverscape that is no longer reliable for nature or people. For 30 years, attempts to 'restore' Delta ecosystems and improve reliability have met with mixed results. For example, reconnection of floodplains to floodwaters has resulted in improved ecological health for native fishes and recharge to localized aquifers. Uncoordinated releases of discharges below dams, however, have resulted in diminished water quality and populations of indicator species. Attempts to create wildlife friendly farms have been countered by an increase in perennial agriculture and commensurate increases in irrigation water demand. From these lessons learned, we demonstrate three key components of a reconciled Delta that will be necessary in the future: 1) full restoration of critical habitats, reconnecting land and water to rebuild ecosystem function; 2) landscape redesign, incorporating natural and engineered infrastructure to create a biologically diverse, resilient landscape to support both agriculture and natural ecosystems, while reducing the impacts of climate change; and 3) recognition that some ecosystem components, including less resilient species, may be lost and other novel components may emerge. These findings serve to reconcile conflicting demands and restoring ecosystem functions in highly altered wetland landscapes worldwide.",2014,agriculture;climate-change;floodplains;groundwater;habitat-restoration;invasive-species;riparian;water-resources,california;central-valley

The approach focuses on retaining specific functional flows or process-based components of the hydrograph in managed systems, including: peak magnitude flows, recession (seasonal transition) flows, dry season low flows, wet season initiation flows, and interannual variability based on climate. Using a series of case studies and specific examples, we illustrate the importance of each key functional flow. In order to maximize the functionality of these flows and thereby maximize aquatic diversity, restoration of channel-floodplain connectivity and sediment transport processes must be enhanced in both space and time. We further provide considerations for managers that include five guiding principles for developing a functional flows approach or incorporating functional flows into existing environmental flow frameworks. We suggest this approach allows for the development of flow regimes that encompass ecosystem processes alongside varied human needs and can be applied in an adaptive management framework allowing for adjustment in non-stationary river environments.",2014,climate-change;floodplains;hydrology;modeling;riparian,global

In this study, a linear optimization model was developed for environmental flows in river systems that have minimal or no regulation from dam operations, but still exhibit altered flow regimes due to surface water diversions and groundwater abstraction. Flow regime requirements for California Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) life history were used as a test case to examine how alterations to the timing and magnitude of water diversions meet environmental flow objectives while minimizing impact to local water supply. The model was then applied to Mill Creek, a tributary of the Sacramento River, in northern California, and its altered flow regime that currently impacts adult spring-run Chinook spawning and migration.

Flow regime, including frequency and magnitude of floods, and its interaction with the surrounding landscape are primary drivers of floodplain structure and ecosystem dynamics. However, these floodplain processes and functions are often altered by water management schemes, land uses, and hydroclimatic alteration induced by climate warming. Improved understanding of ecologically relevant aspects of flow regime and potential future alteration is central to managing floodplain ecosystems and their services. In order to describe the inundation regime of the lower Cosumnes River floodplain, California, this research moves beyond flood frequency analysis to examine other flood event characteristics and identify flood types using statistical cluster analysis. Floods are characterized using metrics of ecological relevance, such as magnitude, timing, duration, and total volume. To explore potential effects of climate change, non-stationary Generalized Extreme Value models are fit to historical floods based on temperature and precipitation at the monthly scale. Temperature and precipitation variables from downscaled Global Climate Models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase-5 are then applied to develop flood distributions for climate change scenarios. These results are used to adjust the magnitude of clustered flood events identified in the historical record, and the sensitivity of the inundation regime to these changes is assessed. This research provides useful scientific insights for management and restoration efforts within the Cosumnes watershed and demonstrates the utility of applying these methods to other floodplain systems.",2014,california;central-valley;climate-change;cosumnes-river;floodplain;floodplains;modeling;riparian;sierra-nevada,california;central-valley;cosumnes-river;sierra-nevada

Here, we develop and apply a screening framework that is focused on the selection of dams that warrant environmental flows on the basis of evidence of hydrologic alteration and ecological impairment. Our approach is illustrated for California, where 181 (of an initial 1400+) dams are identified as high-priority candidates to improve environmental flows for native fish conservation. Given the rapid declines of freshwater biodiversity and pervasive alteration to rivers, this systematic screening approach should be useful for guiding the strategic implementation of environmental flows.",2014,biodiversity;habitat-restoration;hydrology;hydropower,california

Here, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of appropriative water rights to identify where, and to what extent, water has been dedicated to human uses relative to natural supplies. The results show that water right allocations total 400 billion cubic meters, approximately five times the state's mean annual runoff. In the state's major river basins, water rights account for up to 1000% of natural surface water supplies, with the greatest degree of appropriation observed in tributaries to the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and in coastal streams in southern California. Comparisons with water supplies and estimates of actual use indicate substantial uncertainty in how water rights are exercised. In arid regions such as California, over-allocation of surface water coupled with trends of decreasing supply suggest that new water demands will be met by re-allocation from existing uses. Without improvements to the water rights system, growing human and environmental demands portend an intensification of regional water scarcity and social conflict. California's legal framework for managing its water resources is largely compatible with needed reforms, but additional public investment is required to enhance the capacity of the state's water management institutions to effectively track and regulate water rights.",2014,management;water-rights,california

We construct a historic N mass balance of two agricultural regions of California to understand trends and drivers of past and present N loading to groundwater (1945â""2005). Changes in groundwater N loading result from historic changes in three factors: the extent of agriculture (cropland area and livestock herd increased 120 and 800%, respectively), the intensity of agriculture (synthetic and manure waste effluent N input rates increased by 525 and 1500%, respectively), and the efficiency of agriculture (crop and milk production per unit of N input increased by 25 and 19%, respectively).

The central watersheds see less reduction in annual runoff and can adapt better to changes in runoff timing. Generation in southern watersheds, which are less productive, decreases.

Freshwater habitats are disproportionately degraded globally with resultant declines in populations in freshwater fishes and subsequent retractions in biogeographic ranges. Conservation challenges in freshwater are compounded because aquatic taxa are inherently difficult to map. We addressed this problem for California freshwater fishes by developing the software and underlying database. The software consists of a Python program, database, and suite of tools using ESRI ArcGIS scripting interfaces to translate species range data into an electronic record set of occurrences housed in Microsoft Access. The system was designed to capture, store, map, and report on the spatial and temporal dynamics of targeted species by using standard spatial units as primary indexing objects to meet current natural resource management objectives. However, the software not only tracks the provenance of underlying empirical records through space and time, but also is robust to inferential modeling results and expert knowledge, which allows for future empirical discovery and validation. After importing and standardizing 274,555 records from 154 data layers, we found that most existing records are highly concentrated spatially, representing only 39% of the mapping domain. We also determined that most empirical records are skewed toward recreational fisheries, with few records documenting the range of native species found in California. Future biogeographic mapping efforts will be aided by the baseline data and updated range maps contained in the database.

Too often decisions are based on some combination of incomplete hydrologic time series, poorly parameterized models, photographic snapshots of the place in question, and human imagination. Because river ecosystems are dynamic, with ever changing physical dimensions, inferences are made to make up for unknowns, which remain knowledge gaps. This is particularly true in the pursuit of ecogeomorphology, which seeks to understand the interplay between physical processes and ecological responses in river systems over time. Increasing deployment of affordable sensors, however, is beginning to provide information to fill such gaps, but their utility remains constrained by human interpretation.

Completed videos, typically capturing an entire water year, allow for diagnostic viewing of major hydrologic events, and simultaneous assessment of corresponding environmental variables, such as discharge and stream temperature. Further, the hydrolapse approach allows managers to comprehend river behavior, such as changing habitat dimensions in lateral extent and stage, as function of flow regime.

Human suppression of fire in the western United States over the last century has caused notable changes to many ecosystems, especially in lower elevation, semiarid forest types dominated historically by fire tolerant taxa like Pinus and Quercus. Recent increases in fire activity in western US forests have highlighted the need for restoration of ecological structure and function, but management targets for restoration in different forest types remain uncertain. Working in the forests of eastern California, we evaluated the direction and magnitude of change in burned area and fire severity between the period prior to Euro-American settlement (â¼1500â""1850) and the âmodernâ period (1984â""2009). We compared total annual area burned; proportional area burned at low-moderate severity and high severity; and annual area burned at low-moderate severity and high severity between the two time periods in seven forest types. We also examined modern trends in fire area and severity. We found that modern rates of burning are far below presettlement levels for all forest types. However, there were major differences between low to middle elevation forests and high elevation forests regarding the components of this departure. Low and middle elevation forests are currently burning at much higher severities than during the presettlement period, and the departure in fire area is overwhelmingly expressed in the low to moderate severity categories; in these forest types, mean annual area of high severity fire is not notably different between the modern and presettlement periods. In higher elevation forests on the other hand, the modern departure in fire area is expressed equally across fire severity categories. Our results underline the critical need for forest and fire restoration in the study area, especially in low and middle elevation forests adapted to frequent, low severity fire. Expanded management of naturally ignited fires for resource benefit is clearly needed, but in many parts of our study area, strategic reduction of forest fuels will likely be necessary before large-scale restoration of fire becomes ecologically, politically, and financially feasible.",2013,california;forest-fire;management;sierra-nevada,california;sierra-nevada;united-states

As a consequence and over time, most of the water flowing through the state's rivers and streams has been dedicated through water rights to human uses, limiting potential for sustainable water management and climate change adaptation. This history is recorded in a database of water rights, which contains approximately 50,000 records of diversion and storage projects dating from the early 19th century to the present day. Although water rights records are rarely considered in regional water budgeting, information on the location, age, purpose, and face values of water rights offer insight into the spatial and temporal dimensions of water-use pressures and can be used to identify opportunities for management interventions. Using the state water rights database, we calculated cumulative face-value rights at the HUC12-watershed scale and compared water appropriation volumes with modeled predictions of surface water availability. Total annual allocations of current water rights exceed 340 million-acre feet (4 x 1011 m3), approximately five times the state's mean annual runoff. The total volume of face-value water rights is 25 to 1,000% of annual water availability in major river basins (greater than 400 km2), with the greatest degree of appropriation observed in tributaries to the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and coastal streams in southern California. Trends in water rights appropriation since 1900 indicate periods of rapid demand growth between 1925-1940, 1950-1960, and 1975-1985, which mirror major dam building eras. We illustrate how information on the spatial distribution of water rights, appropriation volumes, and priority of use, can guide strategic planning for re-allocating water for environmental benefits and other management objectives.

One stated reason is the lack of specific project-level specificity in future impacts. We demonstrate how a hydropower system operations model, incorporating the latest climatological realizations (3 GCMs x RCPs 4.5 and 8.5), can be used to assess environmental impacts generally, and hydrological flow alterations in particular, during the hydropower licensing process. We demonstrate that we can, in fact, quantify project-level impacts from climate change, albeit within the context of quantified uncertainty about non-stationary future conditions. The systems operations model analysis encompasses the combined effects of the Yuba River Development Project and Yuba-Bear Drum-Spaulding Projects, an interconnected series of complex hydropower systems located in the Sierra Nevada, California. Daily water system operations are simulated using a monthly-scale optimization model for hydropower decisions. Though there is inherent uncertainty generated by the modeling process and operational assumptions (e.g., static energy demand), there are sufficient data, modeling techniques, and analytical approaches to assess the how management decisions made today may be confounded by non-stationary hydroclimates in 30-50 years, which is the duration of most hydropower licenses. Such decisions need to include adaptive management approaches to address not only non-stationary hydroclimates, but also cumulative impacts to ecological functions and processes caused by serial flow manipulation. This study can help provide the scientific guidance needed to improve climate change policy in hydropower system planning.",,california;climate-change;hydrology;hydropower;management;modeling;sierra-nevada,california;sierra-nevada;united-states;yuba-river

However, the sharp changes in discharge caused by this practice have detrimental environmental effects downstream. This study investigated the effects of hydrograph shape on attenuation of regulated pulsed flow events by first categorizing, then modeling the downstream movement of representative pulses on the upper Tuolumne River below Holm Powerhouse in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California. This system was managed by a public utility and produced flow pulses primarily for hydroelectricity generation and/or whitewater recreation. Operations were highly influenced by a system-wide Water First policy, which prioritized drinking water supply and quality over other beneficial uses. Pulses were therefore associated with a spectrum of time scales, from predetermined schedules decided far in advance to hydropeaking operations responding to real-time demands. We extracted underlying hydrograph shape patterns using principal component analysis on individual pulsed flow events released from 1988-2012 (n=4439). From principal component loadings, six shape categories were determined: rectangular, front-step, back-step, goalpost, centered tower, and other. The rectangular and stepped shapes were the most frequent, composing 62% and 24% of total events, respectively. The rectangular shape was often produced by standard hydropeaking or recreational releases, while the stepped shapes were often used for water conservation or were recreational flows bordered by periods of electricity generation. The stepped shape increased in occurrence after the Water First policy took effect in 1993 and dominated two drier years (2007 and 2009). After categorization by shape, magnitude and durational indices were used to fabricate representative pulsed flow events. Attenuation of these representative pulses was then modeled using a 1D hydraulic model of 42 river km prepared in HEC-RAS. As no operational measures or physical structures existed within the system to counter the adverse effects of pulsed flow events, natural attenuation was the only potential major mitigation agent. However, model results demonstrated a clear durational threshold for representative pulses (~ 3-5 hrs) over which the degree of attenuation of ramping rates and peak discharge approached a limit. These thresholds were unique to the study reach and were dependent upon river morphology, bed characteristics, and flow rates. Increasing baseflows did not necessarily increase attenuation of pulses, most likely due to minimal increases in bed friction forces in this fairly steep and confined channel. Simulations of front and back-step representative pulses showed trade-offs between attenuation of peak magnitudes and steepness of ramping rates. Finally, a range of rising ramping rates were shown to steepen downstream above initial rates due to the study reach's channel morphology. Reshaping pulses to be more ecologically benign at all points downstream was infeasible if the system was required to maintain current electricity production and recreational service levels.",,california;hydrology;hydropower;modeling;sierra-nevada,california;montane-rivercalifornia;sierra-nevada

F., & Viers, J. Quantifying the Restorable Water Volume of California's Sierra Nevada Meadows. http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013AGUFM.H31H1298E","The Sierra Nevada is estimated to provide over 66% of California's water supply, which is largely derived from snowmelt. Global climate warming is expected to result in a decrease in snow pack and an increase in melting rate, making the attenuation of snowmelt by any means, an important ecosystem service for ensuring water availability. Montane meadows are dispersed throughout the mountain range and can act like natural reservoirs, and also provide wildlife habitat, water filtration, and water storage. Despite the important role of meadows in the Sierra Nevada, a large proportion is degraded from stream incision, which increases volume outflows and reduces overbank flooding, thus reducing infiltration and potential water storage. Restoration of meadow stream channels would therefore improve hydrological functioning, including increased water storage. The potential water holding capacity of restored meadows has yet to be quantified, thus this research seeks to address this knowledge gap by estimating the restorable water volume due to stream incision. More than 17,000 meadows were analyzed by categorizing their erosion potential using channel slope and soil texture, ultimately resulting in six general erodibility types. Field measurements of over 100 meadows, stratified by latitude, elevation, and geologic substrate, were then taken and analyzed for each erodibility type to determine average depth of incision. Restorable water volume was then quantified as a function of water holding capacity of the soil, meadow area and incised depth. Total restorable water volume was found to be 120 x 10^6 m3, or approximately 97,000 acre-feet. Using 95% confidence intervals for incised depth, the upper and lower bounds of the total restorable water volume were found to be 107 - 140 x 10^6 m3. Though this estimate of restorable water volume is small in regards to the storage capacity of typical California reservoirs, restoration of Sierra Nevada meadows remains an important objective. Storage of water in meadows benefits California wildlife, potentially attenuate floods, and elevates base flows, which can ease effects to the spring recession curve from the expected decline in Sierran snowpack with atmospheric warming.",,california;climate-change;hydrology;sierra-nevada,california;sierra-nevada

Changing hydroclimatic conditions will likely impact water temperatures below dams and affect downstream ecology.

All models are one dimensional and operate on a weekly timestep. Results are presented as water temperature change from the historical time period and indicate that reservoirs release water that is cooler than upstream conditions, although the absolute temperatures of reaches below dams warm with climate change.

While protected areas safeguard some critical habitat, economic realities require conservation efforts in human-dominated landscapes to maintain biodiversity in practice.

Winegrapes are a high-value specialty crop that can both benefit from and contribute to conservation, as producers and consumers increasingly value environmental stewardship.

Hydroclimatic alteration increases vulnerability of montane meadows in the Sierra Nevada; California. http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AGUFMGC11B0986V","Meadow ecosystems of the Sierra Nevada (California, USA) have been maintained by the interplay of biotic and abiotic forces, where hydrological functions bridge aquatic and terrestrial realms. Meadows are not only key habitat for fishes, amphibians, birds, and mammals alike, but also provide enumerable ecosystem services to humans, not limited to regulating services (eg, water filtration), provisioning services (eg, grazing), and aesthetics. Using hydroclimatic models and spatial distribution models of indicator species, a range wide assessment was conducted to assess and synthesize the vulnerability of meadow ecosystems to hydroclimatic alteration, a result of regional climate change. Atmospheric warming is expected to result in a greater fraction of total precipitation falling as winter rain (rather than snow) and earlier snowmelt. These predicted changes will likely cause more precipitation-driven runoff in winter and reduced snowmelt runoff in spring, leading to reduced annual runoff and a general shift in runoff timing to earlier in the year. These profound effects have consequences for hydrological cycling and meadow functioning, though such changes will not occur steadily through time or uniformly across the range, and each individual meadow will respond as a function of its composition and land use history. Most vulnerable is groundwater recharge, a fundamental component of meadow hydrology. As a result of shortened snow melt period and absence of diel snowmelt fluxes that would otherwise gradually refill meadow aquifers, recharge is expected to decline due to less infiltration. Diminished water tables will likely stress hydric and mesic vegetation, promoting more xeric conditions. Coupled with greater magnitude stream flows, these conditions promote channel incision and ultimate state shift to non-meadow conditions. The biological effects of hydroclimatic alteration, such as lower mean annual flow and earlier timing, will result in an overall decrease in available habitat for aquatic species, particularly for cold water fishes (ie, salmonids and sculpins). Earlier timing and longer low flow duration will force aquatic biota to withstand more days at thermally challenging temperatures, potentially promoting non-native species. Decreased mean annual flow, less overall snow volume, and warmer daily air temperatures will potentially decrease the number of days of standing water available for amphibian reproduction. A core strategy for maintaining meadow ecosystems, ecosystem services, and dependent biodiversity is to reduce vulnerabilities, such as unstable stream banks that promote cycles of incision, and increase resilience to disturbance, such as actively removing encroaching vegetation that can overtap water tables and build up wildfire fuels. Reducing meadow vulnerability to hydroclimatic alteration and ensuring sustained ecosystem services will require active ecosystem management (ie, managed for indicator species, but with focus on hydrological functioning); coordinated hydrological management (ie, conservation action and removal of stressors coordinated across all ownerships and management regimes); and effective communication to minimize human activities that reduce resilience, as well as improve human",,california;climate-change;ecosystem-services;groundwater;hydrology;modeling;sierra-nevada;water-resources,california;montane-rivercalifornia;sierra-nevada;united-states

(2010). Modeling Economic Impacts of Environmental Flows in California's Yuba River Watershed. http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AGUFM.H21G1141R","Managing rivers is becoming more challenging with increasing demand for better environmental flow regimes, just as demand for water for hydropower and water supply are increasing and water supplies are changing due to climate change. Restoration of freshwater ecosystems, such as in the Yuba River in Californiaâs Sierra Nevada, will require flows that mimic the natural flow regime, which native freshwater species are uniquely adapted to. In particular, freshwater ecosystems of the Sierra Nevada were historically adapted to the spring snowmelt flows. To study the potential effects of restoring a natural flow regime to the Yuba River watershed, we developed a multi-reservoir network flow optimization model of the watershed that represents environmental flows more ecologically useful than simple minimum instream flows, which are typically the only environmental requirement in streams. The model uses weekly time steps. The objective function is to maximize benefit, which equals hydropower revenue less penalties for deviations from environmental constraints and spills. Constraints include targets for minimum flows, maximum flows, maximum weekly up-ramp rates and maximum weekly down-ramp rates. We applied the model to the Yuba River watershed surface water inflow data from a rainfall-runoff model recently developed for the Sierra Nevada that considers regional climate warming of +0, 2, 4 and 6 Â°C. The Yuba watershed has high potential for fish restoration yet is currently managed primarily for hydropower. We assess the economic effects (primarily impacts on hydropower generation and revenues in the adjacent Bear River) and management implications of increasing and reshaping instream flow requirements in several ecologically important, yet regulated, stream reaches within the Yuba watershed. Further, we explore the potential of using regulating reservoirs to adapt to changing hydrologic conditions. Increasing minimum instream flow magnitudes in the South Fork Yuba River reduces total hydropower generation and revenues by limiting diversions for hydropower. However, imposing environmental flow requirements to more closely mimic the natural flow regime, including spring snowmelt flows, results in much greater hydropower reductions due to reduced operational flexibility. Regulating reservoirs can preserve some components of the natural flow regime, but are not able to compensate for anticipated climate change-induced reductions in total annual flows. The general model is useful for making quantitative and qualitative assessments of potential new environmental flow requirements. With some key improvements, such as considering sub-weekly ramping rates, and adaptation for use elsewhere, the model can provide insights to water resources decision-makers about impacts of imposing different environmental flow conditions on watershed-scale water management schemes.",2010,california;climate-change;habitat-restoration;hydropower;management;modeling;sierra-nevada,california;sierra-nevada;yuba-river

We describe their size, elevation, slope, aspect, and their difference in inherent wetness and solar radiation. We assess the predictive value and field applicability of LMUs by using existing data on stand conditions and two sensitive wildlife species. Stand conditions varied significantly between LMUs, with canyons consistently having the greatest stem and snag densities. Pacific fisher (Martes pennanti) activity points (from radio telemetry) and California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) nests, roosts, and sightings were both significantly different from uniform, with a disproportionate number of observations in canyons, and fewer than expected on ridge-tops. Given the distinct characteristics of the LMUs, these units provide a relatively simple but ecologically meaningful template for managers to spatially allocate forest treatments, thereby meeting multiple National Forest objectives.

It is highly vulnerable to changes in climate due to its sub-Arctic location, unique geography, and permafrost foundation. Combined with its pristine condition, these qualities make the Kobuk an ideal system upon which to build a conceptual model for predicting ecosystem effects of climate change. We constructed a conceptual ecosystem model for the Kobuk River synthesizing surveyed baseline hydrologic, geomorphic and biotic conditions with literature on Arctic rivers. While the mainstem Kobuk has limited biological productivity, it provides spawning habitat and connectivity for large resident and migratory fish that rely upon off-channel habitat for food resources. System function is dependent largely on intermittent pulse flows that connect riverine habitats, allowing periods of late summer high productivity in off-channel habitat. Spring break-up and hill slope processes are critically important for maintaining habitat complexity and inter-connectivity. Climate change models predict the region will experience a disproportionate increase in average winter air temperature relative to summer temperatures, in the number of ice-free days, and in annual rainfall. Our conceptual model predicts that changes to fish and invertebrate populations on the Kobuk River will result not from physiological responses to increased temperatures, but rather to shifts in two main physical drivers: 1) spring break-up intensity, resulting in changes to scour rate and sediment deposition; and 2) discontinuous permafrost melt, resulting in widespread heterogeneous zones of active layer thickening and thermokarsting. The interaction of these two drivers offers four potential scenarios of geomorphic change in the system and four dramatically different biological outcomes.

Our objectives were (1) to evaluate the utility of LiDAR (light detection and ranging) measurements for describing habitat associations of riparian passerine birds, and (2) to capitalize on the ease with which LiDAR measurements can be summarized at multiple spatial scales to evaluate the predictive performance of vegetation measurements across spatial scales from 0.2 to 50 ha. At each location where we conducted point-count surveys of the avian community, we summarized the mean and coefficient of variation of canopy height measured at five spatial scales (0.2, 0.8, 3.1, 12.6, and 50.2 ha). For each of these spatial scales, we used stepwise model selection to identify the best logistic-regression model describing patterns of occurrence for 16 species of passerine birds that were sufficiently abundant for analysis. We then used area-under-the-curve (AUC) values to identify models that performed well (AUC >0.75) on a temporally independent data set. Of the 16 species, 10 species had logistic-regression models with AUC values >0.75. For six of these species, AUC values were highest for the models with vegetation measurements at the 0.2â""3 ha scale. For the other four species, AUC values were highest for the model with vegetation variables measured at the 50-ha scale. These results illustrate the utility of using LiDAR-derived measurements of vegetation to understand habitat associations of riparian birds and underscore the importance of using multiscale approaches to modeling wildlife habitat use.",2009,california;central-valley;cosumnes-river;lidar;modeling;riparian,california;central-valley;cosumnes-river;united-states

Specifically, historical reference conditions may no longer serve as benchmarks for restoration, which may foster a why bother? attitude toward ecological restoration. We review the potential role for riparian restoration to prepare ecological systems for the threats posed by climate change. Riparian ecosystems are naturally resilient, provide linear habitat connectivity, link aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and create thermal refugia for wildlife: all characteristics that can contribute to ecological adaptation to climate change. Because riparian systems and the projected impacts of climate change are highly variable geographically, there is a pressing need to develop a place-based understanding of climate change threats to riparian ecosystems. Restoration practitioners should consider how they can modify practices to enhance the resilience of riparian ecosystems to climate change. Such modifications may include accelerating the restoration of private lands, participating in water management decisions, and putting the emerging field of restoration genetics into practice.",2009,climate-change;habitat-restoration;hydrology;riparian,global

Mediterranean-climate regions in California-Baja California, Chile, South Africa, Australia and the Mediterranean Basin. We undertook a systematic, pan-regional assessment of threats in the mediterranean biome including human population density, urban area and agriculture. To realize the full implications of these threats on mediterranean biodiversity, we examined their relationship with species of conservation concern: threatened mammals at the global scale and threatened plants at the subecoregional scale in California, USA. Across the biome, population density and urban area increased by 13% and agriculture by 1% between 1990 and 2000. Both population density and urban area were greatest in California-Baja California and least in Australia while, in contrast, agriculture was greatest in Australia and least in California-Baja California. In all regions lowlands were most affected by the threats analysed, with the exception of population density in the Chilean matorral. Threatened species richness had a significant positive correlation with population density at global and subecoregional scales, while threatened species were found to increase with the amount of urban area and decrease as the amount of natural area and unfragmented core area increased. Threats to mediterranean biodiversity have increased from 1990 to 2000, although patterns vary both across and within the five regions. The need for future conservation efforts is further underlined by the positive correlation between species of conservation concern and the increase in population density over the last decade.

Understanding the dynamics of complex systems requires scaling-up mechanistic patterns and processes. Coupling hydro-geomorphic processes with vegetation development is an integral step in understanding habitat evolution in riparian corridors. We quantified floodplain deposition dynamics and topographic complexity to better understand how riparian forest structure and composition changed through time and over the floodplain. We used LiDAR data and a temporally-rich dataset of aerial photography coupled with field data to analyze landscape-scale patterns with species composition and floodplain dynamics. We examined the significance of two definable large-scale floodplain processes - meander migration and channel abandonment - that set-up the spatial structure of riparian forest dynamics. In addition, we analyzed the potential feedback of riparian vegetation on floodplain formation. Canopy structure and floodplain heterogeneity generally showed a log-linear relationship over time and were highly correlated with species composition changes over time and with a range of past hydrologies (inter- and intra- annual patterns). These data suggest that analysis of landscape formation processes, in particularly during the early stages, improves our understanding of riparian forest dynamics and that channel abandonment can be a significant alternative pathway to cottonwood recruitment. By analyzing the coupled eco-geomorphic processes we can more effectively scale-up riparian vegetation patterns by applying a functional knowledge of the corridor-wide channel dynamics and floodplain hydrology.",,floodplain;floodplains;hydrology;lidar;remote-sensing;riparian,cosumnes-river

Similar differences were also seen in congener-only comparisons. We found no evidence for two nonexclusive alternatives, that naturally rare species had more extinction-resistant life history traits, or that they belonged to more rapidly speciating taxa than common species. Understanding the association of rare species with benign environments may help in the design of effective conservation strategies for geographic regions of high diversity and endemism under changing climates. In particular, our findings highlight the extra climatic sensitivities of rare species with edaphic or other specialization, and how the needs of these species may be met by either refugia or translocation strategies.",2008,biodiversity;climate-change,global

Californiaâs rivers are highly altered, with levees that disconnect floodplains, dams that alter flows, and land use practices that have destroyed most than 90 percent of riparian habitat. Restoration efforts that reinstate natural hydrologic processes are likely to produce more resilient, functioning ecosystems. At the Cosumnes River Preserve, levees were intentionally breached to restore hydrologic connection between the lower Cosumnes River and its floodplain. This river remains unregulated and floods often in winter and spring. Large floods transport sediment and woody debris through breaches to create complex floodplain topography and stimulate establishment of willow and cottonwood riparian forests. Smaller floods transport nutrients, which stimulate pulses in algal and zooplankton productivity, and maintain connectivity between river and floodplain. Seasonally flooded habitats support up to 33 species of native and alien fish. Native species, which are better adapted to the seasonal pattern of flooding, utilize the floodplain for spawning (Sacramento splittail, blackfish, hitch) and rearing (chinook salmon, Sacramento sucker, pikeminnow). Juvenile chinook salmon grew larger in ephemeral floodplain habitats than in the river or permanent ponds. The Nature Conservancy is using these lessons learned to benefit future restoration at the Preserve and other floodplain rivers in California and beyond. Opportunities to restore natural hydrologic processes that sustain floodplain and riparian habitats, however, may be limited on many rivers.

However meteorological, physical, and biological heterogeneity in this large system present unique challenges to successfully detecting invasive weeds. We present three hyperspectral case studies which illustrate the challenges, and potential solutions, to mapping invasive weeds in wetland systems: 1) Perennial pepperweed was mapped over one portion of the Delta using a logistic regression model to predict weed occurrence. 2) Water hyacinth and 3) submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), primarily composed of Brazilian waterweed, were mapped over the entire Delta using a binary decision tree that incorporated spectral mixture analysis (SMA), spectral angle mapping (SAM), band indexes, and continuum removal products. Perennial pepperweed detection was moderately successful; phenological stage influenced detection rates. Water hyacinth was mapped with modest accuracies, and SAV was mapped with high accuracies. Perennial pepperweed and water hyacinth both exhibited significant spectral variation related to plant phenology. Such variationmust be accounted forin order to optimallymap these species, and this was done for the water hyacinth case study. Submerged aquatic vegetation was not mapped to the species level due to complex non-linearmixing problems between thewater column and its constituents, which was beyond the scope of the current study.

Forty-three cases and 59 controls were enrolled into the study. Serological results showed that 17 (39.5%) of the 43 dog cases were infected with serovar pomona. Cases were 7.86 times more likely to have been walked in a rural environment rather than an urban environment. Cases also had eight times higher odds of swimming in outdoor water, and approximately 12 times higher odds of drinking from outdoor water in the two weeks preceding illness. At smaller distances from the dogs' homes (radius â¤â¤ 0.5 km) hydrographic density was positively correlated with cases, while at larger distances (radius â¥â¥ 5 km) there was a positive relationship between leptospirosis cases and percent of wetlands or public open space. Intervention measures for the prevention of canine leptospirosis should include reducing access to potentially infectious bodies of water that are close to canine homes, and to large areas of wetlands and public open space in the general vicinity. We have shown that a spatial analysis in conjunction with traditional epidemiological analysis is a powerful combination in identifying risk factors for infectious diseases.",2007,gis,california;united-states

Significance of Riparian Plants in the Epidemiology of Pierce's Disease. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/43270261_Significance_of_Riparian_Plants_in_the_Epidemiology_of_Pierce%27s_Disease","We examined the relationship between the occurrence of Pierceâs disease (PD) in Napa Valley vineyards and both adjacent and distant vegetation types. Because the vector, Graphocephala atropunctata (blue-green sharpshooter, BGSS), is mobile and has a broad host range, disease risk is influenced by vector migration among vegetation types. Therefore, certain combinations of vegetation types surrounding vineyards are more likely to be associated with PD. To test this hypothesis, we surveyed for PD in a total of 41 vineyards located adjacent to either riparian woodland (vector habitat), urban land (vector habitat), other vineyards (vector habitat), or oak woodland (habitat status unknown). The proportions of the four vegetation types distant from the sites (within 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 km) were quantified with a geographical information system. Vineyards were surveyed for PD in 11/05. Pathogen presence was confirmed by ELISA. Multiple binary logistic regression showed that both adjacent and distant vegetation type significantly predicted PD presence. Vineyards were more likely to have PD if they were adjacent to riparian woodland and surrounded by more vineyards or urban land. These results suggest that vineyards and urban lands may be important in PD epidemiology. Given that uninfected vineyards adjacent to riparian woodland were also surrounded by large amounts of riparian and upland woodland, it is also possible that riparian woodland in more forested landscapes hosts lower vector densities or a lower proportion of infective vectors. Alternatively, more expansive woodland may be associated with lower PD risk because it decreases the spread of infective BGSSs.",2006,agriculture;riparian;vineyards,california

Characterizing Hydrologic Variability of the Cosumnes River Floodplain. https://watershed.ucdavis.edu/doc/cosumnes-research-group/flood-regime-variability","Natural riverine and floodplain ecosystems are adapted to highly variable hydrologic regimes, which include periodic droughts, infrequent large floods, and relatively frequent periods of inundation. To more effectively manage water resources and maintain ecosystem services provided by rivers and their floodplains requires that we understand seasonal and inter-annual hydrologic variability. We present here a Matlab program called Flood Regime Characterization (FRC), which has been developed to aid researchers and water managers in characterizing historical streamflow variability by developing a set of flood types and water year types. The foundation of the program is based on the concept that a flood regime is made up of four components: magnitude, duration, timing, and frequency. The flood types are created by separating out similar flood events based on their magnitude (i.e., peak flow), duration and indirectly, their timing. Once the flood types are identified, the frequency of each type is calculated for the entire record. Water year types are then separated from each other by divisive clustering, wherein similar water years are clustered together based on the number of days each flood type occurs during each water year. Users are presented with the calculated frequency of each water year type throughout the record.",2006,california;central-valley;cosumnes-river;ecosystem-services;floodplain;floodplains;hydrology;modeling;riparian,california;central-valley;cosumnes-river

(2006). Human Impacts; Plant Invasion; and Imperiled Plant Species in California. http://www.jstor.org/stable/40062006","Invasive species are one of the fastest growing conservation problems. These species homogenize the world's flora and fauna, threaten rare and endemic species, and impose large economic costs. Here, we examine the distribution of 834 of the more than 1000 exotic plant taxa that have become established in California, USA. Total species richness increases with net primary productivity; however, the exotic flora is richest in low-lying coastal sites that harbor large numbers of imperiled species, while native diversity is highest in areas with high mean elevation. Weedy and invasive exotics are more tightly linked to the distribution of imperiled species than the overall pool of exotic species. Structural equation modeling suggests that while human activities, such as urbanization and agriculture, facilitate the initial invasion by exotic plants, exotics spread ahead of the front of human development into areas with high numbers of threatened native plants. The range sizes of exotic taxa are an order of magnitude smaller than for comparable native taxa. The current small range size of exotic species implies that California has a significant invasion debt that will be paid as exotic plants expand their range and spread throughout the state.",2006,agriculture;biodiversity;invasive-species;modeling;productivity,california;united-states

Chlorophyll a (Chl a) distribution across a 0.36 km2 restored floodplain (Cosumnes River, California) was analysed throughout the winter and spring flood season from January to June 2005. In addition, high temporal-resolution Chl a measurements were made in situ with field fluorometers in the floodplain and adjacent channel The primary objectives were to characterise suspended algal biomass distribution across the floodplain at various degrees of connection with the channel and to correlate Chl a concentration and distribution with physical and chemical gradients across the floodplain Our analysis indicates that periodic connection and disconnection of the floodplain with the channel is vital to the functioning of the floodplain as a source of concentrated suspended algal biomass for downstream aquatic ecosystems Peak Chl a levels on the floodplain occurred during disconnection, reaching levels as high as 25 Î¼g Lâ'1. Chl a distribution across the floodplain was controlled by residence time and local physical/biological conditions, the latter of which were primarily a function of water depth During connection, the primary pond on the floodplain exhibited low Chl a (mean = 3.4 Î¼g Lâ'1) and the shallow littoral zones had elevated concentrations (mean = 4.6 Î¼g Lâ'1); during disconnection, shallow zone Chl a increased (mean = 12.4 Î¼g Lâ'1), but the pond experienced the greatest algal growth (mean = 14.7 Î¼g Lâ'1) Storm-induced floodwaters entering the floodplain not only displaced antecedent floodplain waters, but also redistributed floodplain resources, creating complex mixing dynamics between parcels of water with distinct chemistries. Incomplete replacement of antecedent floodplain waters led to localised hypoxia in non-flushed areas The degree of complexity revealed in this analysis makes clear the need for high-resolution spatial and temporal studies such as this to begin to understand the functioning of dynamic and heterogeneous floodplain ecosystems.",2006,california;central-valley;cosumnes-river;floodplain;floodplains;modeling;productivity;riparian,california;central-valley;cosumnes-river

carbon-stock-quantification,Carbon stock quantification in a floodplain restoration chronosequence along a Mediterranean-montane riparian corridor,elizabeth-clifton;josh-viers,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969724039767,Clifton, B., & Viers, J. (2024). Carbon stock quantification in a floodplain restoration chronosequence along a Mediterranean-montane riparian corridor.,Uncertainty in the global carbon (C) budget has been reduced for most stocks though it remains incomplete by not considering aquatic and transitional zone carbon stocks. A key issue preventing such complete accounting is a lack of available C data within these aquatic and aquatic-terrestrial transitional ecosystems. Concurrently quantifiable results produced by restoration practices that explicitly target C stock accumulation and sequestration remain inconsistent or undocumented. To support a more complete carbon budget and identify impacts on C stock accumulation from restoration treatment actions we investigated C stock values in a Mediterraneanmontane riparian floodplain system in California USA. We quantified the C stock in aboveground biomass large wood and litter in addition to the C and total nitrogen in the upper soil profile (5 cm) across 23 unique restoration treatments and remnant old-growth forests. Treatments span 40 years of restoration actions along seven river kilometers of the Cosumnes River...,2024,agriculture;ai;biomass;carbon;carbon-storage;climate;cosumnes-river;floodplain-restoration;forest-carbon;land;large-wood;multi-benefit-restoration;nature-based-solutions;nitrogen;plant-diversity;restoration;riparian-floodplain;river-restoration;soil-carbon,cosumnes-river;global;sierra-nevada;washington

(2022). Assessing climate change risks to water resources of the Columbia River Basin using an integrated modeling approach.,The Columbia River Basin (CRB) a major water resource for the northwestern USA faces substantial challenges due to climate change driven hydrologic variability. The CRB provides water for hydropower generation agriculture fisheries municipal supply and recreation. This study aims to quantify climate change induced risks and sensitivities in the CRB's water resources through an integrated modeling approach. The modeling framework uses the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model coupled with a water resource management model (MODSIM) to simulate historical and future hydrologic conditions under multiple Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Results indicate significant shifts in snowpack timing and volume leading to earlier and higher spring runoff and lower summer flows. These changes impact reservoir operations hydropower generation and agricultural water supply...,2022,climate;modeling;water-resources,global;washington
floodplain-connection-nutrient-algae,Floodplain Connection Frequency Controls Nutrient Availability and Algae Productivity in a Mediterranean-Climate Regulated River,jack-severson;elizabeth-clifton;josh-viers,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021JG006764,Severson, J., Clifton, B., & Viers, J. (2022). Floodplain Connection Frequency Controls Nutrient Availability and Algae Productivity in a Mediterranean-Climate Regulated River.,Floodplains are critical transitional zones but their roles as sources and sinks of carbon and nutrients are poorly understood especially in seasonally dry Mediterranean climates. We examine the temporal and spatial gradients across the floodplain Our analysis indicates that periodic connection and disconnection of the floodplain with the channel is vital to the functioning of the floodplain as a source of concentrated suspended algal biomass for downstream aquatic ecosystems. Peak Chl a levels on the floodplain occurred during disconnection reaching levels as high as 25 ug L-1. Chl a distribution across the floodplain was controlled by residence time and local physicalbiological conditions the latter of which were primarily a function of water depth. During connection the primary pond on the floodplain exhibited low Chl a (mean = 3.4 ug L-1) and the shallow littoral zones had elevated concentrations (mean = 4.6 ug L-1); during disconnection shallow zone Chl a increased (mean = 12.4 ug L-1) but the pond experienced the greatest algal growth (mean = 14.7 ug L-1). Storm-induced floodwaters entering the floodplain not only displaced antecedent floodplain waters but also redistributed floodplain resources creating complex mixing dynamics between parcels of water with distinct chemistries. Incomplete replacement of antecedent floodplain waters led to localised hypoxia in non-flushed areas. The degree of complexity revealed in this analysis makes clear the need for high-resolution spatial and temporal studies such as this to begin to understand the functioning of dynamic and heterogeneous floodplain ecosystems.,2022,algae;cosumnes-river;floodplain;modeling;nutrients;productivity;river-ecosystem;water-resources,cosumnes-river;sierra-nevada
floodplain-ag-decision-making,Floodplain Agroecology: Towards multi-benefit decision-making for agricultural water resilience,lorenzo-booth;elizabeth-clifton;josh-viers,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2022.996116/full,Booth, L., Clifton, B., & Viers, J. (2022). Floodplain Agroecology: Towards multi-benefit decision-making for agricultural water resilience.,The concept of ‘multi-benefit’ is central to the pursuit of water resilience in highly engineered agricultural landscapes like California's Central Valley. One important strategy is using floodplains as an opportunity for multi-benefit outcomes combining agricultural production with ecosystem services like groundwater recharge and habitat restoration. The emerging field of floodplain agroecology explores these connections. We characterize the decision-making landscape of multi-benefit floodplain agroecology and discuss challenges in implementation including the need for better data and tools to quantify benefits. We find a lack of integrated decision-making tools to support the trade-offs inherent in multi-benefit strategies. Future work must integrate hydrologic ecological and socio-economic data to create spatially explicit decision-support tools that incorporate uncertainty. This will help bridge the gap between policy and on-the-ground implementation of multi-benefit projects.,2022,agriculture;california;communities;groundwater-recharge;multi-benefit;restoration;water-resources,san-joaquin-valley;sierra-nevada
riparian-plant-community,Assessing spatio-temporal dynamics in riparian plant community composition and structure following large-scale river restoration,ryan-cervantes;josh-viers,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S146290112200084X,Cervantes, R., & Viers, J. (2022). Assessing spatio-temporal dynamics in riparian plant community composition and structure following large-scale river restoration.,River restoration is a primary focus for ecosystem management yet there is limited understanding of its long-term effects on riparian systems particularly in highly modified agricultural environments. We examine the long-term (2000-2018) spatio-temporal response of the riparian plant community to large-scale river restoration along the Cosumnes River California USA. Specifically we analyze changes in species richness plant community composition and vegetation structure across three restoration treatments (passive reforestation active reintroduction of native species and non-intervention/control) and an established forest remnant. Our results indicate that restoration treatments successfully established and maintained native plant communities with distinct trajectories relative to the control and forest remnant. Passive reforestation led to increased species richness and cover of native species while active reintroduction led to faster establishment of structural complexity and canopy cover. Both treatments converged in species richness over time. The established forest remnant maintained high levels of native species richness and structural complexity throughout the study period. Success of the restoration treatments depended on the initial site characteristics and hydrologic connectivity with the river. Overall the study provides a valuable long-term perspective on the effectiveness of different restoration strategies in promoting riparian plant community recovery and highlights the importance of site-specific management in modified river systems.,2022,california;restoration;water-resources,cosumnes-river;sierra-nevada
water-use-prediction,A machine learning framework for high resolution water use prediction in highly heterogeneous agricultural landscapes,vicky-espinoza;josh-viers,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037837742100411X,Espinoza, V., & Viers, J. (2022). A machine learning framework for high resolution water use prediction in highly heterogeneous agricultural landscapes.,Water use estimation in highly heterogeneous agricultural landscapes is critical for sustainable water management particularly in drought-prone regions like California's Central Valley. Traditional methods often rely on coarse scale data or simplified assumptions which struggle to capture the complex spatial and temporal dynamics of water consumption across diverse crop types and irrigation practices. We propose a machine learning framework that integrates remote sensing data meteorological variables and detailed land use records to predict agricultural water use at high spatial resolution (30m). Our approach employs a Random Forest regression model trained on a comprehensive dataset from the San Joaquin Valley. The model demonstrated high accuracy (R2 > 0.85) in predicting annual crop-specific water use. Key drivers of water use variability include crop type evapotranspiration (ET) demand and irrigation system efficiency. The framework offers a robust and scalable tool for water managers to support the implementation of Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) and optimize regional water allocations.,2022,agriculture;ai;modeling;sgma;water-resources,san-joaquin-valley;washington
integrated-modeling-climate-change,Integrated modeling of surface water and groundwater systems in the Sacramento Valley California: Implications for climate change and water management,abid-sarwar;josh-viers,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/14/19/3151,Sarwar, A., & Viers, J. (2022). Integrated modeling of surface water and groundwater systems in the Sacramento Valley California: Implications for climate change and water management.,California's Sacramento Valley is a vital water source for the state yet its water resources face growing pressure from climate change and competing demands. Understanding the interconnectedness of surface water (SW) and groundwater (GW) systems is crucial for sustainable management. We developed an integrated SW-GW modeling framework combining the MODFLOW and MODSIM models to simulate the hydrologic system under historical and future climate scenarios. The model was calibrated and validated against observed streamflow and GW levels demonstrating good performance. Under projected climate change scenarios results show reduced snowpack early spring runoff and increased GW reliance especially during dry periods. The study highlights the need for adaptive water management strategies emphasizing increased GW storage and coordinated SW-GW operations to enhance regional water resilience.,2022,climate;modeling;water-resources,california
floodplain-plant-productivity,Controls on plant productivity in a managed Mediterranean-climate riparian floodplain,elizabeth-clifton;josh-viers,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972101372X,Clifton, B., & Viers, J. (2021). Controls on plant productivity in a managed Mediterranean-climate riparian floodplain.,Riparian floodplains in Mediterranean climates are characterized by high inter-annual variability in hydrology creating dynamic conditions for plant communities. We investigate the primary controls on net primary productivity (NPP) in a managed riparian floodplain along the Cosumnes River California using remote sensing and long-term monitoring data (2000-2018). Our analysis focuses on the influence of inundation frequency duration and timing as well as inter-annual variability in temperature and precipitation on vegetation indices (NDVI EVI) as a proxy for NPP. We find that NPP is positively correlated with inundation frequency and duration but is negatively impacted by extreme high flows. The timing of inundation particularly late-season flooding can suppress annual plant growth. Warmer temperatures generally increase NPP but drought years lead to significant reductions. Restoration treatments designed to enhance floodplain connection showed higher and more stable NPP compared to unmanaged areas. The results underscore the critical role of hydrologic regime in regulating floodplain productivity and provide valuable insights for adaptive management strategies aimed at maximizing ecosystem services in these dynamic systems.,2021,floodplain;modeling;restoration;water-resources,cosumnes-river;sierra-nevada

(2021). Remote sensing and machine learning for enhanced agricultural management in the western US.,The application of remote sensing (RS) and machine learning (ML) is revolutionizing agricultural management especially in high-value high-diversity regions like the Western United States. These technologies provide unprecedented spatial and temporal data for monitoring crop health water use pest infestation and yield prediction. This review article synthesizes the current state of the art focusing on studies relevant to specialty crop production. We discuss the integration of various RS platforms (satellite aerial UAV) with ML algorithms (Random Forest CNNs) to address challenges in land use classification evapotranspiration estimation and precision irrigation scheduling. Key findings highlight the success of deep learning models in complex crop classification and the potential of combining thermal and multispectral imagery for advanced water stress detection. Challenges remain in data harmonization model interpretability and scaling solutions for smallholder farms. The paper concludes with an outlook on future research directions including the integration of climate models and socio-economic data for holistic agricultural decision support.,2021,agriculture;ai;modeling;water-resources,washington
hydrologic-modeling-snowpack,Sensitivity of hydrologic modeling to snowpack representation in the Sierra Nevada California,abid-sarwar;josh-viers,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/13/21/3034,Sarwar, A., & Viers, J. (2021). Sensitivity of hydrologic modeling to snowpack representation in the Sierra Nevada California.,Accurate simulation of snow processes is critical for water resource management in snow-dominated regions like the Sierra Nevada California which supplies a significant portion of the state's water. We investigate the sensitivity of the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model to different snow physics parameterizations and forcing data resolutions. The study compares simulations using a standard temperature-index approach versus a more complex energy-balance approach for snowmelt modeling. Results show that the energy-balance model improves the timing and magnitude of spring runoff especially under warmer conditions. Furthermore the use of higher-resolution meteorological forcing data significantly reduces uncertainties in streamflow predictions particularly in complex terrain. The findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate snow physics and input data for reliable water supply forecasting and climate change impact assessments in mountain watersheds.,2021,climate;modeling;water-resources,sierra-nevada

(2021). Artificial intelligence for decision support in agriculture: Challenges and opportunities.,Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to transform agricultural decision-making from field-level management to regional resource allocation. This perspective piece explores the current landscape of AI applications in agriculture highlighting both the technical opportunities and practical challenges. Opportunities include enhanced precision in irrigation fertilization and pest control through machine learning-driven analytics. Challenges encompass data access and quality model interpretability and the need to integrate socio-economic factors into AI-based recommendations. We emphasize the necessity of co-developing AI tools with end-users (farmers consultants policymakers) to ensure practical relevance and adoption. The future success of agricultural AI depends on building robust scalable and trustworthy systems that address the complex and heterogeneous nature of farming environments.,2021,agriculture;ai;communities,global;washington
crop-modeling-climate-variability,Using crop modeling to assess the impact of climate variability on agricultural productivity in California,vicky-espinoza;josh-viers,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/13/18/2507,Espinoza, V., & Viers, J. (2021). Using crop modeling to assess the impact of climate variability on agricultural productivity in California.,Climate variability particularly the increase in extreme heat and drought events poses significant threats to California's agricultural sector. We utilize the DSSAT crop model to simulate the impacts of historical and projected climate variability on the yield of key California crops (e.g. almond tomato). The model is calibrated and validated using long-term yield data and site-specific weather records. Results demonstrate that increasing temperatures lead to reduced yields for temperature-sensitive crops while the impact of drought is primarily mediated through changes in water availability. Adaptation strategies such as shifting planting dates or adjusting irrigation regimes are evaluated. The study provides quantitative estimates of climate change impacts on agricultural productivity supporting informed decision-making for water and land management.,2021,agriculture;climate;modeling,california
groundwater-storage-economic-value,Valuing groundwater storage in agricultural regions: An economic and hydrologic approach,lorenzo-booth;josh-viers,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030147972030225X,Booth, L., & Viers, J. (2020). Valuing groundwater storage in agricultural regions: An economic and hydrologic approach.,Sustainable Groundwater Management requires quantifying the value of groundwater storage particularly in over-drafted agricultural regions like California's San Joaquin Valley. We develop a coupled economic-hydrologic modeling framework to estimate the economic value of changes in groundwater storage. The model simulates the impact of pumping restrictions and recharge strategies on agricultural profitability and regional water supply reliability. Results indicate that the marginal value of groundwater storage is highest during drought years. The study provides a methodology for water agencies to assess the benefits of various groundwater sustainability projects such as managed aquifer recharge (MAR) and quantify the economic trade-offs of SGMA implementation.,2020,agriculture;communities;modeling;sgma;water-resources,san-joaquin-valley

(2020). Quantifying drought impacts on agricultural water use in California's Central Valley.,California's Central Valley agriculture is heavily impacted by recurring drought events leading to increased groundwater pumping and economic losses. We use remote sensing data and publicly available water use records to quantify the spatial and temporal impacts of historical drought periods (e.g. 2012-2016) on agricultural water demand and supply. Key findings show a significant increase in groundwater dependence during drought years with shifts in crop patterns towards high-value drought-resilient crops. The analysis provides critical data for water resource planners to develop drought contingency plans and manage the transition to sustainable water use under SGMA.,2020,agriculture;climate;modeling;sgma;water-resources,san-joaquin-valley

(2020). Design guidelines for sustainable river restoration projects in Mediterranean climates.,River restoration projects in Mediterranean climates face unique challenges due to seasonal hydrology and high inter-annual variability. Based on decades of monitoring and research along the Cosumnes River California we propose a set of design guidelines to enhance the sustainability and ecological effectiveness of restoration efforts. These guidelines emphasize the importance of promoting natural geomorphic processes incorporating large wood structures and utilizing native plant species adapted to variable flow regimes. Key recommendations include designing for complexity rather than simplicity and prioritizing active channel-floodplain reconnection. The paper provides practical advice for practitioners aiming to maximize biodiversity and ecosystem services in these sensitive environments.,2020,restoration;water-resources,cosumnes-river;sierra-nevada
